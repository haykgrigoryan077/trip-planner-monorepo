# Project Setup and Running Instructions

## Frontend Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or higher)

### Steps to Run Frontend

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <project-directory>

2. Install dependencies:
    npm install

3. Run the development server:
    npm start
    This will start the frontend on http://localhost:3000. You can access your application in the browser at that address.
